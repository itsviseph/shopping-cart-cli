🛒 Shopping Cart CLI App

A simple, beginner-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) shopping cart program written in Python.
This project helped me learn core concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and clean code structure.

📌 Features

View available products

Add items to the cart

View items already in the cart

Calculate total amount

Checkout and exit program

Clean function-based structure (easy to upgrade)

🧠 What I Learned

How to build a CLI program

How to structure code using functions

How to avoid code duplication

How to loop until the user chooses to exit

Basic logic for cart systems

🧩 How It Works

The program shows a menu:

add item

view cart

checkout

end

When the user selects an option, the respective function executes:

add_item() → add products

view_cart() → show cart + total

view_items() → show available catalog

On checkout, the cart is shown one last time and the program ends.

▶️ Running the App

📌 Future Improvements

Some ideas for expanding this project:

Remove items from cart

Add quantity support

Add discount codes

Add taxes

Save receipt to a file

Convert to Object-Oriented version
